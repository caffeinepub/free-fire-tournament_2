  "summary": "Professional dark-themed Free Fire gaming tournament website with red and black accents. App flow: Welcome screen (first screen for unauthenticated users) with Login and Sign Up options; Sign Up collects Name, Email, WhatsApp Number, and Free Fire UID; Login uses Email and Password. After successful login/signup, user is redirected to the Live Lobby screen which serves as the permanent home for authenticated users. The Live Lobby shows a vertical scrollable list of Active Tournament/Room Cards (Solo, Duo, Squad, Clash Squad, Full Map) with entry fee, prize pool, slots progress bar, countdown timer, and a 'Join Now' button. 'Back to Home' on registration/payment page redirects to /lobby (not auth screens). Authenticated users are never redirected to login/splash screens — the old landing page is disabled/hidden for logged-in users. Other features: Tournaments List, Registration Form, Rules Page, Leaderboard, and Contact/Support sections. Mobile-responsive design with dark Free Fire-themed backgrounds.",
