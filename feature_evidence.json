      "featureTitle": "Create a new 'Secure Payment' section component and insert it in App.tsx immediately before the RegistrationForm section. The section must display: (1) a heading 'Secure Payment', (2) the text 'Pay the entry fee to the following UPI ID to participate: 8728872927@fam', (3) a 'Copy ID' button that copies '8728872927@fam' to the clipboard and shows a brief confirmation feedback (e.g., text changes to 'Copied!'), and (4) a note reading 'Please keep the transaction screenshot ready for the form'. The section background should use a slightly red tint (e.g., a dark red overlay or bg color like #1a0505 or rgba(229,62,62,0.10)) consistent with the existing red/black Free Fire theme. Style with bold Orbitron/Rajdhani fonts, sharp angular design elements, and red accent borders/highlights matching the site's existing aesthetic.",
