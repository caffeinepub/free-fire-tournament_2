  "summary": "The implementation fully satisfies REQ-10. A new SecurePayment component was created and inserted in App.tsx immediately before RegistrationForm. It displays the heading 'Secure Payment', the UPI ID text with '8728872927@fam', a Copy ID button with 'Copied!' feedback, and the screenshot note. The background uses dark red tints consistent with the Free Fire theme, and the component uses Orbitron/Rajdhani fonts with angular design elements and red accents. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
