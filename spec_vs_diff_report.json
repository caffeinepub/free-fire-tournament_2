  "summary": "The diff implements changes to ManualDepositModal.tsx that address all four requirements. REQ-1 (no auto-advance after UPI intent), REQ-2 (no premature auto-return timer), REQ-3 (correct UPI URI construction with encoded parameters), and REQ-4 (Verify Payment button shown after intent is launched) are all present in the modified file. The implementation is consistent with the acceptance criteria.",
