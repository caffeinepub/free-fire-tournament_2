  "summary": "Both REQ-1 (backend minimum deposit validation) and REQ-2 (frontend ManualDepositModal enforcement) appear to be implemented. The backend has a migration file setting minimumDepositAmount to 10.0 and the frontend component sets MIN_AMOUNT = 10 with appropriate validation. However, the error message in the frontend uses a trailing period ('Minimum deposit amount is ₹10.') while the AC specifies 'Minimum deposit amount is ₹10' (no period), and the backend main.mo is truncated so the actual rejection logic cannot be fully verified.",

      "requirement": "Submitting an amount below ₹10 shows a validation error: 'Minimum deposit amount is ₹10'.",
      "reason": "The frontend code sets the error message as 'Minimum deposit amount is ₹${MIN_AMOUNT}.' with a trailing period, which does not exactly match the required message 'Minimum deposit amount is ₹10' (no trailing period) as specified in the acceptance criteria.",

      "reason": "The build request only asked to update the minimum deposit validation threshold to 10 rupees. Adding a persistent stable variable via a migration module goes beyond the requirement of simply changing a validation constant, altering the actor's state schema in ways not requested.",
